# Shop cart boilerplate

This is not serious project, I treat it more like a huge Laravel sandbox for me. I wanted to implement some usefull and popular Laravel and OOP concepts or code patterns. You will not find great design here cuz frontend side was not the main pourpose of this project, but I have experimented with testing, services, middlewares, external api, facades, mails and so on.

You can find here:

-   Some test for user roles in app
-   Cart logic implemeted via cart service
-   Order logic
-   Roles implemented via middleware
-   Integration with mails(user gets order confirmation in his mail with small easter egg which may grant user to admin)
-   Simple integration with [NBP](https://api.nbp.pl/) api for fetching currency exchange rate
-   Logic related with recalculated prices based on chosen currency
