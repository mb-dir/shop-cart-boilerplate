# Shop cart boilerplate

This is not serious project, I treat it more like a huge Laravel sandbox for me. I wanted to implement some usefull and popular Laravel and OOP concepts or code patterns. You will not find great design here cuz frontend side was not the main pourpose of this project, but I have experimented with testing, services, middlewares, external api, facades, mails and so on.
